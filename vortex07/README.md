overthewire.org vortex level 7
==============================

The vulnerability exposed in [vortex level 7](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/vortex7.shtml) is a basic buffer overflow with two subtleties:

1. The CRC of the buffer must equate to a given value (0xe1ca95ee)
2. The buffer is quite small (58 bytes)


Manipulating the checksum
-------------------------

The [cyclic redundancy check (CRC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) computes a check value (or checksum), which is used to detect *accidental* changes in data, e.g. when transmitting over unreliable communication channels. With this error detecting code, the slightest error (i.e. bit-flip) in the input data results in a very different output. As opposed to [cryptographic hash functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) like SHA1 or MD5, preimage resistance is not a property of CRC, it is not designed to withstand [preimage attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack): given a checksum *C*, it is not hard to find an input *m* such that *CRC(m) = C*. As such, one shouldn't rely on it for integrity checks over insecure channels since it is very easy to manipulate it as is shown in the solution.
To solve this level, I chose to apply the CRC-reversing algorithm described in [Reversing CRC â€“ Theory and Practice (SAR-PR-2006-05)](http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf), which by the way also contains a very nice introduction to CRC. The method consists in appending a 32bit pattern to the buffer in order to adjust the CRC-remainder to the desired checksum. The same principle is proposed in the suggested lecture, [CRC and how to Reverse it](http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/crctut1.htm). But as opposed to the first approach which uses the inverse of the divisor polynomial, the bit pattern is derived using a system of equations.
