This level consists in finding a 5 character password (using characters a-zA-Z0-9) which MD5 hash is 155fb95d04287b757c996d77b5ea51f7.
You can use a password cracking tool to find it, such as [hashcat](http://hashcat.net/) or [John The Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/).
I used [md5crack](http://md5crack.com/) (online) to retrieve the password: rlTf6
